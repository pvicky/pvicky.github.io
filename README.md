# Overview
This simple react app acts as front-end to a crowd-sourced sports database that allows you to search for soccer players or clubs by name and view their profiles and other info. Currently we have implemented views for players, clubs and leagues.

# Technical difficulties
As the app uses db that contains a lot of missing data, pages may contain missing sections or pictures.

# Future features
At first I wanted to add more info to some pages, for example player statistics by season or trophies won by clubs.
However, as these features are not implemented by the database it makes calls from, we would need to implement a backend server ourselves.
